**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Set up your ROS Workspace.
2. Download or clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) into the ***src*** directory of your ROS Workspace.  
3. Experiment with the forward_kinematics environment and get familiar with the robot.
4. Launch in [demo mode](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/7b2fd2d7-e181-401e-977a-6158c77bf816/modules/8855de3f-2897-46c3-a805-628b5ecf045b/lessons/91d017b1-4493-4522-ad52-04a74a01094c/concepts/ae64bb91-e8c4-44c9-adbe-798e8f688193).
5. Perform Kinematic Analysis for the robot following the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view).
6. Fill in the `IK_server.py` with your Inverse Kinematics code.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

Here is the annotated figure of the robot.

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1
1->2 | - pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 |  -pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.50 | q4
4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.193 | 0

In DH parameters,  
`alpha(i-1)` : Angle between Z(i-1) and Z(i) measured along X(i-1)   
`a(i-1)` : Link length, distance between Z(i-1) and Z(i), measured along X(i-1)   
`d(i)`  : Link offset, distance between X(i-1) and X(i), measured along Z(i-1), variable in prismatic joints(there are no prismatic joints in the given problem)   
`theta(i)` : Joint angle, Angle between X(i-1), X(i) measured along Z(i), variable in revolute joints.   
Also, 

In this robot arm,
`Link 0` represents the base link, and   
`Link 7` represents the gripper link, which is fixed.  

**Link 1 :** `Z0`(0 0 1) is *collinear* to `Z1`(0 0 1), `alpha0 = 0`, `a0 = 0`, `d1 = 0.33(joint1.z) + 0.42(joint2.z) = 0.75`, and `theta1` is *unknown*. `0.33` and `0.42` can be found in <joint> in the urdf file. 

**Link 2 :** `Z1`(0 0 1) is *perpendicular* to `Z2`(0 1 0), so, `alpha1 = -pi/2` (it is much easier to look at the picture above), `a1 = 0.35(joint2.x)`, and `d2 = 0` since `X1` intersects `X2` at `O2`. Also, we can see that when joint2 is in *zero* configuration, there is always an offset of `-pi/2` from `X1` to `X2`, measured along `Z2`. So, we also need to substitute `theta2` with `theta2 - pi/2` in the parameter table.   

**Link 3 :**, since `Z2`(0 1 0) is *parallel* to `Z3`(0 1 0), `alpha2 = 0`, `a2 = 1.25(joint3.z)` along `X2`. Also, `X2` and `X3` are collinear, so `d3 = 0`.   

**Link 4 :**, `Z3`(0 1 0) and `Z4`(1 0 0) are *perpendicular*, so `alpha3 = -pi/2` and `a3 = -0.054(joint4.z)`, and `d4 = 0.96(joint4.x) + 0.54(joint5.x) = 1.50`.   
*Note:* We have choosen O4, O5 and O6 to be co-incident with the Wrist Center(WC). This helps in separating the IK problem into computation of the Wrist Center and then Wrist Orientation.   

**Link 5 :**, `Z4`(1 0 0) and `Z5`(0 1 0) are *perpendicular* and *intersect* at `O5`, so `alpha4 = pi/2` and `a4 = 0`. Also, `d5 = 0`, since `X4` and `X4` are *collinear*.   

**Link 6 :**, `Z5`(0 1 0) and `Z6`(1, 0, 0) are *perpendicular* and *intersect* at `O5`, so `alpha5 = -pi/2` and `a5 = 0`, `d6 = 0`, since `X5` and `X6` are *collinear*.   

**Link 7(Gripper Link) :**, this is a fixed link, with a translation along `Z6`. So, `Z6` and `Zg` are *collinear*, so `alpha6 = 0`, `a6 = 0` and `d6 = 0.193(joint6.x) + 0.11(gripper_joint.x)`. Also, since this is fixed(w.r.t link 6), `q7 = 0`.  

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
